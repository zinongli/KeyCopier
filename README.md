# Key Copier App
A Flipper Zero app for measuring key bitting patterns.

## Installation
The best way to install the latest build would be download it from Flipper Zero's Official App Store:
https://lab.flipper.net/apps/key_copier

## Instruction
To measure your key: 
1. Place it on top of the screen.
2. Use the contour to align your key.
3. Adjust each pin's depth until they match. It's easier if you look with one eye closed.
